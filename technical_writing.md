## Building Your Portfolio

### What You Already Have

**Published Articles (27 total):**
- Mastering ZSH series (4 parts: hooks, completion system, prompts, widgets)
- Glob patterns series (2 parts: invisible abstraction, complete syntax reference)
- README as landing page (documentation sprawl and extraction patterns)
- Error handling guides (error-envelope patterns, Rust error handling)
- Shell scripting, developer tools, and system architecture
- All articles: comprehensive (1,500-5,000+ words), with code examples and diagrams

**Open Source Projects (10 Production Tools):**

1. **dotfiles** - Solve the "my dev environment is different on every machine" problem
   - One command to replicate your entire development setup across macOS, Linux, Windows, WSL2
   - Pulls secrets from Bitwarden/1Password/pass and injects them into configs automatically
   - Modular design: enable only what you need (package managers, shell configs, workspace layouts)
   - Integration with Claude Code for AI-assisted development workflows

2. **dotclaude** - Switch between different Claude Code contexts instantly
   - Problem: You work on multiple projects with different coding standards, each needs different Claude instructions
   - Solution: Profile system with inheritance - base configs + project overrides
   - Detects project context automatically via `.dotclaude` file
   - Git hooks for auto-activating profiles when switching branches

3. **error-envelope** (Rust) - Stop writing the same error handling boilerplate in every API
   - Standardized HTTP error format: error code, message, trace ID, retry hints
   - 18 predefined error types (validation, auth, rate limit, etc.) with automatic HTTP status codes
   - Framework-agnostic: works with Axum, Actix, or raw HTTP
   - Clients know exactly how to handle errors and whether to retry

4. **err-envelope** (Go) - Same problem as error-envelope, but for Go APIs
   - Minimal implementation: consistent error responses without framework bloat
   - Trace ID middleware for tracking errors across microservices
   - Structured logging integration (slog) for production debugging
   - Drop-in replacement for manual error handling

5. **vaultmux** - Write secrets code once, support 8+ secret managers
   - Problem: Customers use different secret managers (AWS, GCP, Azure, Bitwarden, 1Password, pass)
   - Solution: Unified Go interface - same API regardless of backend
   - Write your application logic once, deploy anywhere
   - Session caching and mock backend for testing

6. **pipeboard** - Clipboard that works like a Unix pipe across machines
   - SSH-sync clipboards between your laptop and remote servers (encrypted)
   - Named clipboard slots: store multiple items, recall by name
   - Transform clipboard content (base64 encode, jq filter, grep)
   - Zero telemetry: all data stays on your machines

7. **gcp-secret-manager-emulator** - Test GCP Secret Manager code without GCP
   - Full gRPC implementation that runs locally in milliseconds
   - No credentials, no network, no GCP project needed
   - Use official Google client library, point at localhost instead of GCP
   - Deterministic testing: same secrets every run in CI/CD

8. **utf8fx** - Make GitHub READMEs beautiful without external services
   - Generate tech badges, progress bars, gauges locally as SVG
   - 24 Unicode text styles (bold, italic, script, monospace, etc.)
   - Never breaks: no external APIs, renders at commit time
   - Offline-first: works without internet, no rate limits

9. **domainstack** - Full-stack validation from API to frontend, one definition
   - Define validation rules once in Rust (email, length, range, regex, dates)
   - Generate OpenAPI/JSON schemas automatically for API docs
   - Compile same rules to WebAssembly for client-side validation
   - Framework adapters for Axum, Actix, Rocket - plug validation into routes

10. **prettychars** - Add Unicode symbols to CLI output without copying from websites
    - Name-based lookup: `glyph("check")` → ✓, `glyph("arrow_right")` → →
    - 531 named glyphs across categories (arrows, shapes, math, emoji)
    - Zero runtime cost: compile-time perfect hash function
    - 24 text styles: bold, italic, strikethrough (terminal-compatible)

**What These Projects Show:**
- **Abstractions that eliminate repetitive work** - vaultmux, error-envelope, domainstack
- **Local-first tooling** - utf8fx, gcp-emulator, pipeboard (no external dependencies)
- **Cross-platform consistency** - dotfiles, dotclaude (same experience everywhere)
- **Developer experience focus** - prettychars, pipeboard (CLI ergonomics)
- **Production-ready design** - trace IDs, structured logging, encryption, testing infrastructure

**Documentation Volume:**
- Blog: 94,152 lines (verified)
- OSS projects: ~96,000 lines (9 verified at 86,011 + pipeboard estimated ~10k)
- Total: ~190,000 lines

**This is Staff-level documentation volume.**

### What to Add (Optional)

**1. API Documentation Sample**
- Pick a public API with poor docs
- Rewrite a section as sample
- Shows API docs ability

**2. Tutorial Sample**
- "Build X with Y" style guide
- Step-by-step, code examples

**You already have all four types in your blog.** No additional samples needed unless applying to a specific role that asks for something different.

---

## Interview Preparation

### Common Questions

**"Why do you want to move from engineering to technical writing?"**

Good answer:
- "I've realized I get more satisfaction from teaching and explaining systems than building them. My blog has 27 articles because I genuinely enjoy breaking down complex topics. I want to do that full-time."
- Or: "I want a hybrid role where I can leverage my engineering experience to create better documentation. I've seen how bad docs slow down developers, and I want to fix that."

Bad answer:
- "I'm tired of coding" (sounds burnt out)
- "Writing is easier than engineering" (not true, sounds lazy)

**"What's your experience with [docs tool]?"**

If you don't know the tool:
- "I haven't used [tool] specifically, but I'm familiar with docs-as-code workflows. I can get up to speed quickly."
- "I've used [similar tool], and the concepts are transferable."

If you do know it:
- Show examples from your blog/projects

**"How do you handle working with difficult engineers?"**

Good answer:
- "I've been an engineer for 4 years, so I understand the perspective. Engineers resist docs when they're not given time or when docs feel like busywork. I focus on making docs easy - I draft them, they review. I ask specific questions instead of 'can you document this?'"

**"How do you prioritize what to document?"**

Good answer:
- "I start with what users ask about most - support tickets, GitHub issues, Slack questions. High-impact, high-confusion areas first. Then foundational concepts. Polish comes last."

**"Show me your writing process."**

Walk through one of your blog articles:
1. Pick a topic based on pain point (glob patterns - everyone uses, nobody learns)
2. Research (check existing docs, test examples)
3. Outline structure (TOC first)
4. Write sections with examples
5. Test all code examples
6. Edit for clarity
7. Get feedback (if applicable)
8. Publish

### Technical Tests

**Many companies give writing tests:**
- "Document this API" (give you OpenAPI spec)
- "Write a tutorial for X"
- "Explain this technical concept"

**Your advantage:** You can actually test the code and understand the system. Most writers copy-paste from engineering specs. You can verify, improve, and catch errors.

**Preparation:**
- Practice writing a quick API reference (30 minutes)
- Practice writing a tutorial (1 hour)
- Practice explaining a complex system (your blog already does this)
