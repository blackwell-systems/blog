## What to Avoid vs. Pursue

### Pursue: Developer-Facing Documentation

**Good:**
- API documentation (REST, GraphQL)
- CLI tool documentation
- SDK/library documentation
- Internal platform documentation (Kubernetes, CI/CD)
- Developer onboarding guides
- Architecture decision records (ADRs)
- Runbooks and operational docs
- Integration guides for engineers

**Characteristics:**
- Audience: Software engineers
- Content: Code examples, API specs, architecture
- Style: Technical, precise, assumes programming knowledge

### Avoid: End-User Business Documentation (Unless You Like It)

**Skip:**
- End-user manuals ("Click the Submit button")
- Business process documentation ("How to file a TPS report")
- Compliance/regulatory documentation
- Non-technical user guides
- Enterprise software user manuals (SAP, Oracle, etc.)

**Characteristics:**
- Audience: Business users, non-technical staff
- Content: Screenshots, step-by-step UI instructions
- Style: Simple, assumes no technical knowledge

**Exception:** If you find this interesting, do it. But based on your blog content, you're more suited to developer-facing docs.

## Why Your Background is Valuable

### Enterprise Backend Engineering + Writing = Rare Combination

**Most technical writers:**
- Come from journalism/English backgrounds
- Learned tech on the job
- Struggle with complex systems (microservices, distributed systems)
- Need engineers to explain everything

**You:**
- Built backend systems for 4 years
- Understand microservices, APIs, databases, messaging
- Can read code and understand architecture
- Don't need things explained - you've built them

**This means:**
- You can write docs faster (no learning curve)
- You catch technical errors engineers miss
- You have instant credibility with engineering teams
- You can influence API design for better documentation

### Hospitality Domain Experience

**Advantage for:**
- Travel tech companies (Booking.com, Expedia, Airbnb)
- Hospitality platforms (Amadeus, Sabre, IDeaS, Duetto)
- Payment platforms (hospitality-focused)
- Point-of-sale systems (Toast, Square, Lightspeed)

You understand:
- Booking flows, availability, inventory
- PCI compliance, payments, chargebacks
- Integrations with property management systems
- Real-time pricing, revenue management

**This domain knowledge + technical writing = very valuable niche.**

## Building Your Portfolio

### What You Already Have

**Published Articles (10+):**
- Mastering ZSH series (4 parts)
- Glob patterns series (2 parts)
- README as landing page
- Error handling guides

**Project Documentation:**
- error-envelope: API documentation, README, ERROR_CODES.md, ARCHITECTURE.md
- blackdot: CLI tool documentation, hook system docs

**This is already a strong portfolio.**

### What to Add (Optional)

**1. API Documentation Sample**
- Pick a public API with poor docs
- Rewrite a section as sample
- Shows API docs ability

**2. Tutorial Sample**
- "Build X with Y" style guide
- Step-by-step, code examples
- Shows tutorial writing

**3. Conceptual Documentation Sample**
- "How X Works Under the Hood" (like your glob article)
- Architecture explanation
- Shows ability to explain complex systems

**4. Reference Documentation Sample**
- Complete API reference
- Shows attention to detail, completeness

**You already have all four types in your blog.** No additional samples needed unless applying to a specific role that asks for something different.

---

## Interview Preparation

### Common Questions

**"Why do you want to move from engineering to technical writing?"**

Good answer:
- "I've realized I get more satisfaction from teaching and explaining systems than building them. My blog has 10+ articles because I genuinely enjoy breaking down complex topics. I want to do that full-time."
- Or: "I want a hybrid role where I can leverage my engineering experience to create better documentation. I've seen how bad docs slow down developers, and I want to fix that."

Bad answer:
- "I'm tired of coding" (sounds burnt out)
- "Writing is easier than engineering" (not true, sounds lazy)

**"What's your experience with [docs tool]?"**

If you don't know the tool:
- "I haven't used [tool] specifically, but I'm familiar with docs-as-code workflows. I can get up to speed quickly."
- "I've used [similar tool], and the concepts are transferable."

If you do know it:
- Show examples from your blog/projects

**"How do you handle working with difficult engineers?"**

Good answer:
- "I've been an engineer for 4 years, so I understand the perspective. Engineers resist docs when they're not given time or when docs feel like busywork. I focus on making docs easy - I draft them, they review. I ask specific questions instead of 'can you document this?'"

**"How do you prioritize what to document?"**

Good answer:
- "I start with what users ask about most - support tickets, GitHub issues, Slack questions. High-impact, high-confusion areas first. Then foundational concepts. Polish comes last."

**"Show me your writing process."**

Walk through one of your blog articles:
1. Pick a topic based on pain point (glob patterns - everyone uses, nobody learns)
2. Research (check existing docs, test examples)
3. Outline structure (TOC first)
4. Write sections with examples
5. Test all code examples
6. Edit for clarity
7. Get feedback (if applicable)
8. Publish

### Technical Tests

**Many companies give writing tests:**
- "Document this API" (give you OpenAPI spec)
- "Write a tutorial for X"
- "Explain this technical concept"

**Your advantage:** You can actually test the code and understand the system. Most writers copy-paste from engineering specs. You can verify, improve, and catch errors.

**Preparation:**
- Practice writing a quick API reference (30 minutes)
- Practice writing a tutorial (1 hour)
- Practice explaining a complex system (your blog already does this)

## Decision: Full-Time Technical Writing vs. Hybrid Role

### Full-Time Technical Writing

**Pros:**
- Deep focus on documentation quality
- Clear career path (Junior → Senior → Staff → Lead)
- Less on-call, less production pressure
- Writing every day

**Cons:**
- Engineering skills may atrophy
- Can feel disconnected from product
- Lower ceiling than staff engineer ($200k vs $300k+)
- May miss hands-on coding

**Good if:** You genuinely prefer writing to coding, want work-life balance, enjoy teaching/explaining.

### Hybrid Role (Documentation Engineer / Developer Advocate)

**Pros:**
- Keep engineering skills sharp
- Build tools to support documentation
- Higher salary ceiling
- More variety in work

**Cons:**
- May not be "deep" in either writing or engineering
- Can be pulled in multiple directions
- Fewer roles available (niche)

**Good if:** You like both writing and building, want flexibility, enjoy variety.

### Stay Engineer, Write on the Side

**Pros:**
- Highest salary potential (staff engineer = $300k+)
- Keep all engineering career options open
- Blog builds personal brand
- Less risk

**Cons:**
- Writing is "extra" work, not your job
- May not have time to write consistently
- Don't get feedback/editing from team

**Good if:** You like engineering, writing is a hobby, want the blog to stay fun.
