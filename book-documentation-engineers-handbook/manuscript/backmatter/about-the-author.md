# About the Author

Dayna Blackwell is a software architect, technical author, and founder of Blackwell Systems. With over 225,000 lines of published documentation across 10+ open-source projects and five years building enterprise systems, Dayna brings an engineering-first approach to documentation.

This book emerged from years of scaling documentation systems from "write some docs" to "docs engineering team"—and realizing no comprehensive guide existed for this emerging discipline.
