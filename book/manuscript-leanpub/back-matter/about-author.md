# About the Author

**[Your Name]** is a software architect and systems engineer specializing in distributed systems, API design, and data architecture. With [X] years of experience building production systems at scale, [he/she/they] has worked with JSON-based architectures across microservices, data pipelines, and public APIs.

This book emerged from years of hands-on experience navigating JSON's ecosystem - solving real problems with validation, binary formats, streaming, and security. Rather than dismissing JSON's limitations or blindly adopting alternatives, [Your Name] developed a framework for understanding when each technology in the JSON ecosystem makes sense and when to look beyond it.

The architectural lens applied throughout this book comes from building systems that process millions of requests per day, debugging production incidents at 3am, and mentoring teams through technology decisions that would impact their systems for years.

**Thank you for reading.** Whether you're building your first REST API or architecting systems at scale, I hope this book gives you a practical framework for navigating the JSON ecosystem and making technology decisions that serve your actual problems rather than chasing trends.

The best technology choice is the one that solves your problem with the least complexity. Sometimes that's JSON. Sometimes it's not. Now you have the tools to decide.
