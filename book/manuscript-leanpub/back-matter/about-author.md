# About the Author

**Dayna Blackwell** is a software architect, technical author, and the founder of Blackwell Systems. A "builder-first" advocate for developer experience, Dayna has shipped 10 open-source production tools ranging from unified secrets management (vaultmux) to modular development frameworks (blackdot), all maintained with the same rigor as the enterprise systems she architects.

With five years of experience in the high-stakes world of enterprise hospitality--designing APIs that serve millions and data pipelines processing billions of events--Dayna specializes in making complex, "high-consequence" systems accessible. She is a prolific technical writer with over 225,000 lines of published documentation, 3x AWS Certified, and a specialist in infrastructure-as-code (Terraform, CDK, Pulumi) and cloud architecture.

This book emerged from years of navigating JSON's ecosystem in production: implementing validation with JSON Schema for high-volume APIs, optimizing bandwidth with binary formats like MessagePack, debugging streaming data pipelines with JSON Lines, and securing authentication with JWT. Rather than dismissing JSON's limitations or blindly adopting alternatives, Dayna developed a framework for understanding when each technology in the JSON ecosystem makes sense and when to look beyond it.

The architectural lens applied throughout this book comes from building systems that process millions of requests per day, debugging production incidents at 3am, and mentoring teams through technology decisions that would impact their systems for years. Her approach: match tools to problems, embrace modularity where it adds value, and remember that "best practice" changes as architecture evolves.

## Acknowledgments

This book wouldn't exist without the support and feedback of many people:

**Technical reviewers** who caught architectural gaps and challenged my assumptions, improving every chapter.

**The open-source community** behind JSON Schema, MessagePack, JWT, and countless other JSON ecosystem tools that made this book possible.

**Every developer** who asked "why JSON?" and pushed me to articulate the architectural principles behind technology choices rather than just following best practices.

**My colleagues in enterprise hospitality tech** who taught me that high-volume, high-consequence systems demand both rigor and pragmatism.

**Early readers** who provided honest feedback on drafts, helping transform this from documentation into a practical guide.

**Thank you for reading.** Whether you're building your first REST API or architecting systems at scale, I hope this book gives you a practical framework for navigating the JSON ecosystem and making technology decisions that serve your actual problems rather than chasing trends.

The best technology choice is the one that solves your problem with the least complexity. Sometimes that's JSON. Sometimes it's not. Now you have the tools to decide.
