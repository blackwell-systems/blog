1. ✓ Chapter 14 (5,000 words) - Synthesis, applies existing knowledge **COMPLETE**
2. ✓ Chapter 10 (6,000 words) - Comparison-focused, data already gathered **COMPLETE**

**Medium difficulty:**
3. ✓ Chapter 13 (6,000 words) - Testing patterns with examples **COMPLETE**
4. Chapter 11 (7,000 words) - API patterns (practical)
