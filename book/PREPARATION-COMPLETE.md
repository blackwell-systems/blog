## Writing Targets

### New Chapter Word Counts

| Chapter | Target | Sections | Difficulty |
|---------|--------|----------|------------|
| Chapter 10 | 6,000 | 9 | Medium (comparison-heavy) |
| Chapter 11 | 7,000 | 7 | Medium (pattern-heavy) |
| Chapter 12 | 7,000 | 7 | High (architecture-heavy) |
| Chapter 13 | 6,000 | 8 | Medium (code-heavy) |
| Chapter 14 | 5,000 | 7 | Low (synthesis) |
| **Total** | **31,000** | **38** | **Mixed** |

### Current Book Status

**Foundation chapters (1-9):** 55,790 words ✓ COMPLETE

**New chapters (10-14):**
- Outlines: 10,497 words (prep material)
- Diagrams: 53 created and ready
- Target writing: 31,000 words
- Status: Ready to write

**Front/Back matter:** 7,000 words (to be written)

**Projected total:** 93,790 words (~208 pages)

---

## Writing Strategy

### Recommended Order

**Easy wins first (build momentum):**
1. Chapter 14 (5,000 words) - Synthesis, applies existing knowledge
2. Chapter 10 (6,000 words) - Comparison-focused, data already gathered

**Medium difficulty:**
3. Chapter 13 (6,000 words) - Testing patterns with examples
4. Chapter 11 (7,000 words) - API patterns (practical)

**Highest complexity:**
5. Chapter 12 (7,000 words) - Complete architectures, most technical depth

### Phased Approach

**Week 1-2:** Chapters 14 + 10 (11,000 words)  
**Week 3-4:** Chapters 13 + 11 (13,000 words)  
**Week 5-6:** Chapter 12 (7,000 words)  
**Week 7:** Front/back matter (7,000 words)

**Total time:** ~7 weeks of focused writing

## Key Benefits of Preparation

### Before Prep (Traditional Approach)
- Stare at blank page
- Research while writing (context switching)
- Discover missing data mid-chapter
- Inconsistent structure across chapters
- Slower writing pace (~200 words/hour)

### After Prep (Our Approach)
- Clear structure to follow
- All research complete
- All diagrams ready to insert
- Consistent patterns across chapters
- Faster writing pace (~500+ words/hour)

**Estimated time savings:** 40-50 hours across 5 chapters

---

## Diagram Summary

### Total Diagrams by Type

**Flowcharts:** 28 diagrams
- Decision trees, processes, architectures

**Sequence diagrams:** 8 diagrams
- API flows, authentication, messaging

**Timelines:** 4 diagrams
- Evolution, migration, deprecation

**Comparison charts:** 13 diagrams
- Format comparisons, trade-offs

### Color Palette Used

All diagrams use consistent dark theme:
- Dark fills: `#3A4A5C`, `#3A4C43`, `#4C4538`, `#4C3A3C`
- Borders: `#6b7280`
- Text: `#f0f0f0`
