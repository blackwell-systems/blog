## Projects

This blog supports two main projects:

**[dotfiles](https://github.com/blackwell-systems/dotfiles)** - AI-native dotfiles with multi-vault secret management, health checks, and Claude Code integration. The first dotfiles solution designed for AI-assisted development.

**[dotclaude](https://github.com/blackwell-systems/dotclaude)** - Profile manager for Claude Code that lets you switch between work/personal profiles and route between AI backends (Max/Bedrock).

Stay tuned for technical deep dives, tutorials, and behind-the-scenes development notes.
