**Dayna Blackwell** is a software architect and technical author specializing in high-throughput, event-driven systems at scale. I design the systems that keep data moving reliably--from backend services and API integrations to analytics pipelines and the infrastructure supporting them.

Currently, I work on the global loyalty and promotions platform for a major hospitality brand, designing and operating services behind rewards programs, digital wallets, and large-scale promotional campaigns used by customers worldwide. My work spans backend services (Python FastAPI/Pydantic, Java Jakarta EE), event-driven architectures (AWS Lambda, SNS/SQS, EventBridge, DynamoDB), and data engineering (AWS Glue, Redshift ETL pipelines transforming single-table designs into analytics-ready relational models).

As the author of **You Don't Know JSON** (107,000 words exploring the JSON ecosystem), I've spent years deep-diving into the protocols defining modern web communication. My expertise lies in building event-driven architectures that are not just scalable, but "hard to break"--focusing on idempotency, Content-Based Deduplication, Selective Semantic Hashing, and observability patterns (Datadog, Splunk, CloudWatch) that make distributed systems understandable when things break.

This blog covers developer tools, backend architecture, event-driven systems, data pipelines, infrastructure-as-code, and the lessons learned building production systems at scale.

## Books

**[You Don't Know JSON](https://leanpub.com/you-dont-know-json)** - A comprehensive guide to JSON's ecosystem: from schema validation to binary formats (MessagePack, CBOR, Protocol Buffers), streaming architectures, security patterns, API design, data pipelines, and testing strategies. Learn when JSON works, when it doesn't, and what to use instead. Available on Leanpub.

## Open Source Projects

### Developer Tools

**[blackdot](https://blackwell-systems.github.io/blackdot/#/)** - Modular development framework with multi-vault secrets, Claude Code integration, extensible hooks, and health checks.

**[dotclaude](https://blackwell-systems.github.io/dotclaude/#/)** - Profile manager for Claude Code. Switch between work/personal contexts, multi-backend routing.

**[gcp-secret-manager-emulator](https://github.com/blackwell-systems/gcp-secret-manager-emulator)** - Lightweight gRPC emulator for Google Cloud Secret Manager API. Local testing and CI/CD without GCP credentials.

### Libraries

**[domainstack](https://github.com/blackwell-systems/domainstack)** - Full-stack validation ecosystem for Rust: Type-safe validation with automatic TypeScript/Zod schema generation, serde integration, OpenAPI schemas, and web framework adapters (Axum, Actix, Rocket).

**[error-envelope](https://github.com/blackwell-systems/error-envelope)** - Consistent, traceable, retry-aware HTTP error responses for Rust APIs — no framework required.

**[vaultmux](https://github.com/blackwell-systems/vaultmux)** - Go library for unified secret management across Bitwarden, 1Password, and pass. Interface-first design with 95%+ test coverage.

**[err-envelope](https://github.com/blackwell-systems/err-envelope)** - Structured HTTP error responses for Go. Works with net/http, Chi, Gin, and Echo. Machine-readable codes, field validation, trace IDs.

### Utilities

**[mdfx](https://github.com/blackwell-systems/mdfx)** - Make your GitHub README stand out — tech badges (like shields.io, but better), progress bars, gauges, and Unicode text effects. Local and customizable.

**[pipeboard](https://blackwell-systems.github.io/pipeboard/#/)** - Secure clipboard sharing over SSH tunnels. Share text between machines without exposing ports or using third-party services.
